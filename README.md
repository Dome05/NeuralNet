# NeuralNet
## What can this library do?
This project is, as the title might suggest, all about neural networks. A lot of projects are based on problems, we are not quite sure how to solve.
In this kind of cases, some sort of neural network might come in handy. At the time, NeuralNet is capable of creating, training, and using fully connected neural networks.
However I have planned to add other forms of neural nets, as well as things like genetic or neat algorithms.

Any questions? Then ask the [Discord](https://discord.gg/XTgedujqkw) or open an new [discussion](https://github.com/Dome05/NeuralNet/discussions/categories/q-a)!

## How to set up a project?

If you decided to use my library and don't know how to set up a project, just check the project's [wiki](https://github.com/Dome05/NeuralNet/wiki/Getting-started). It contains a complete documentation of the project.
